Throughout the course we will be taking advantage of several online services and computing resources offered by Indiana University and other providers.
You will need to create accounts for these services/resources as soon as possible.

- [GitHub](https://github.com) (hosting for code, lab notebooks)
- JetStream (on-demand computing resource); not yet launched, will update when available
