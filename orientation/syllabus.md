## Synopsis

This course is a hands-on, workshop-style class covering data processing and analysis of large scale genomics data.
Following a brief primer on basic computing skills, the course will focus on analysis of real data, with material selected from a variety of topics, including read mapping, RNA-seq, and genome assembly.
Students will have access to high-performance computing resources at IU and national cyberinfrastructure portals for biological research.

At each step of the learning process, class participants will collaborate to produce tutorial/how-to style documentation of their work and will gain practical experience with electronic lab notebook keeping.
Sample data will be provided, but students will have abundant opportunity to analyze original data.
The course experience will culminate with a term project that encourages participants to explore topics of their particular interest in greater depth or to progress with their own research work.

## Prerequisites

This interdisciplinary course is primarily directed at graduate students in biology and bioinformatics.
Students are expected to be familiar with the biological motivations of genomic research.

Familiarity with UNIX/Linux operating systems and the shell (or "command line") is not a strict prerequisite, but students will be expected to get up to speed with these skills quickly.
Some class time will be devoted to this at the beginning of the course, but students without relevant experience will be expected to invest time out of class as well.
The remainder of the course will rely heavily on these skills.

## Textbook and other reading materials

During the first few weeks, we will use the book <u>Bioinformatics Data Skills</u> by Vince Buffalo (available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Bioinformatics-Data-Skills-Reproducible-Research/dp/1449367372/) and [O'Reilly Books](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do)) to get up to speed on the Linux shell, version control with git, and basic programming.
This is really an excellent book, which you will want to own and keep as a reference after this course.
You may even consider trying to convince your PI to purchase a couple of copies to keep on hand in your lab!

For the remainder of the course, reading assignments will be drawn from review papers and original articles in published scientific literature.

## Assignments

Class assignments will come in two general flavors.
First, small simple assignments with detailed step-by-step instructions will be provided as an introduction to each topic.
Class participants will be expected to reproduce these assignments by following the provided steps and taking notes of the process: what worked, what didn't, what was learned, potential pitfalls, etc.
Second, more open-ended assignments will be given with each topic that provide an opportunity for students to sample the wide variety of publicly available tools and data (or their own lab's data if they would like).
In both cases, students will be expected to utilize remote computing resources both inside and outside the classroom, and to submit their assignments via the course-associated wiki pages.

## Grading

Final grades will be based on class participation.
There will be graded reading quizzes for each unit, and students will also have frequent opportunities to present their class work to their peers.
These presentations will graded both by the instructor and peers.
The primary purpose of these assessments is to motivate participants to be prepared for and participate in class, as well as to provide feedback early and often.
A short final presentation on a term project at the end of the course will take the place of a final exam.
